  description: 'When I finished kindergarten, my parents gave me a Sega Genesis and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. I was obsessed. From there I went on to play lots of games from the Final Fantasy Series to Mega Man X and Gran Turismo. My favorite game growing up was Sonic 3 & Knuckles. The music was great and the cutscenes between levels blew my mind.',

  game: 'Amplitude',
  description: "At the ripe age of 3, I received a Game Boy Color from my parents, and my life was forever changed. Ever since then, I've been absolutely obsessed with all things video games. My favorite game from my childhood was Amplitude from Harmonix Studios. The precursor to Harmonix\'s big breakthrough game, Guitar Hero, Amplitude was a rhythm game where you controlled a space ship flying between the various tracks of a song in order to score points. Whenever a section of a track was played successfully, the music would auto-play for a period of time, allowing you to move onto the other instruments. By combo-ing these track loops, you could earn combo multipliers and really begin to play every part of the song. And with great tracks from artists such as David Bowie, P!nk, Slipknot, Weezer, and others, a music-obsessed kid like me could fall in love with all the beautiful sights, electric sounds, and addicting gameplay.",

  game: 'Tom & Jerry (GBC)',
  description: "There was this Tom & Jerry platformer for the Gameboy Color. It controlled worse than Mario and the art wasn't nearly as good. What I loved about it was that the levels were set in locations like what you'd see in the cartoon: a kitchen, a garage, rooftops and rain gutters. I've gone through dozens of AA batteries on that game alone.",

  game: 'The Legend of Zelda (1986)',
  description: "On a sunny morning, many, many years ago, a young boy wiped off the dust of an original Atari. He put in Defender, Boxing, Ninja, and was hooked! From that day forward he was meant to be the lead in Player One, but Mr. Steven took too long, and the kid grew too old... The video game that truly got me hooked was The Legend of Zelda. I loved the way you could increase the health, pick up better items, solve puzzles, and the story! To this day, I can still hear the theme music, the fairy music, the sounds when Link took damage. All great memories.  ",

  description: "Games were pretty much banned when I was a kid, but my parents finally caved when I was 10 and stuck in a hospital for 2 weeks with nothing to do. They gave me the tiniest handheld Tetris game and I am still an addict to this day. When I'm not zoning out and imagining tetrominoes falling into place, you can find me on my Animal Crossing island.",
